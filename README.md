# Short Reflection

## 1. How did you implement event handling for user actions?
I used the setOnClickListener() method for the Submit button. When it was clicked, it read the input from the EditText fields and displayed the result in the TextView.

## 2. What techniques ensured smooth and stable interaction?
I added input validation to check if the fields were not empty and used a try-catch block to handle invalid inputs. I also used Toast and Snackbar messages to give instant feedback to the user.

## 3. What improvements would you add in future versions?
In future versions, I would like to improve the app’s design using Material components and maybe add features like saving data or clearing input fields automatically after submission.

In summary, today’s activity helped me understand how to handle user input and button click events in Android Studio using Kotlin. I learned how to connect the layout elements to the code and make the app respond properly when the user interacts with it.
